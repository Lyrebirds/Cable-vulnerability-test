# Work in Progress

We are working on completing the vulnerability test script. Sorry for the inconvenience.

## Can you tell me what the script will do, so I can test it myself?

Yes. Search for web service on your local network, likely on 192.168.100.1. The port differs from modem to modem, so either scan for it, or check the known ports in the [report](https://github.com/Lyrebirds/cable-haunt-report/releases/latest).
