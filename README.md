# Cable Haunt Test Script
​
This is a script for automatically testing wether you modem is vulerable for the [Cable Haunt Vulnerability](https://cablehaunt.com).
​
**ONLY RUN THIS CODE ON HARDWARE YOU OWN**
​
## How run the script
```
sudo pipenv install
```

```
pipenv run python test.py
```

## How it works

The script automatically scans your network to find the spectrum analyser and tries to establish connection to the websocket. The script will test if the modem rejects requests from an external origin, by setting the header parameters similar to how a browser or other modern client would. If the connection is established the spectrum analyser can be reached indirectly from outside the local network and is, at least partly, vulnerable. The script will afterwards, with your permission, send a specially crafted package that reboots the modem if vulnerable. If this happens the modem is completely vulnerable.
